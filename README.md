## Instructions and Navigations
All of the codes are organized into folders. For example, Chapter01.

The code will look like the following:
```
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=365)

future['PT08.S1(CO)'] = df['PT08.S1(CO)'].mean()
future['NMHC(GT)'] = df['NMHC(GT)'].mean()
future['NOx(GT)'] = df['NOx(GT)'].mean()
forecast = model.predict(future)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for IoT developers, engineers, and tech enthusiasts, particularly those with a background in Python, looking to integrate artificial intelligence and machine learning into IoT systems. Python developers eager to apply their knowledge in new, innovative ways will find it useful. It’s also an invaluable guide for anyone with a foundational understanding of IoT concepts ready to take their skills to the next level and shape the future of intelligent devices.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-15).

## Software and Hardware List
Before you begin, a working knowledge of Python is essential, as the book focuses on applying AI techniques through hands-on coding. All code examples are provided in Python and can be run easily on Google Colab, requiring minimal setup. Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts will be helpful but is not mandatory. Step-by-step instructions are included to guide you through practical implementation.

| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-15 | Keras 3 | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-15 | pandas | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-15 | NumPy | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-15 | scikit-learn | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-15 | Matplotlib | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-15 | Seaborn | Windows, macOS, or Linux |

Besides the dependencies and hardware/software requirements listed, some chapters may require additional libraries specific to the use case being discussed. These dependencies are mentioned clearly at the beginning of each relevant chapter, along with step-by-step installation instructions.
